    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "With this tutorial, you will tackle such an established problem in computer vision as fine-grained classification of bird species. The notebook demonstrates how to classify bird images from the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 ([CUB-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html)) dataset using PyTorch, one of the most popular open-source frameworks for deep learning experiments. \n",

    "**Project outline** \n",

    "Here you can get familiarized with the content more properly (the respective CRISP-DM stages of the project are indicated in parentheses):\n",

    "By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand basics of image classification problem of bird species.\n",
    "- Determine the data-driven image pre-processing strategy.\n",
    "- Create your own deep learning pipeline for image classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Motivation** \n",
    "\n",
    "Bird species recognition is a difficult task challenging the visual abilities for both human experts and computers. One of the interesting task related to that problem implies the classification of birds by species using imagery data collected from aerial surveys. Bird populations are important biodiversity indicators, so collecting reliable data is quite [important](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.patrec.2015.08.015) to ecologists. Recognition of bird species also benefits companies developing wind farms producing renewable energy, since their construction requires the prior risk assessment of bird collisions, threatening many of the worldâ€™s species with extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, of course, would be a very ambitious plan to try to find the solution for this problem within a single notebook, so let's make it simple and focus on the bird classification. To make it even more concise, here, we are going to create and evaluate a deep learning model to classify bird images from the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 ([CUB-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html)) dataset. In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform the data-driven image pre-processing, build a baseline ResNet-based classifier, and to improve its performance for even better results in bird species recognition using different techniques, which will be described later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to be solved through the notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do corrupted images exist in our dataset?\n",
    "2. What would be the optimal data transformation strategy?\n",
    "3. Are there any image-specific biases that can limit the model performance?\n",
    "4. How to handle overfitting given the limited amount of training samples?\n",
    "5. How to improve the model performance in bird species recognition?\n",

    "\n",
    "As it was said before, deep neural networks require a lot of training samples. Practitioners have noticed that, in order to train a deep neural network from scratch, the amount of data should grow exponentially with the number of trainable parameters. The minimal number of samples per class should be roughly 1k or more (which is, of course, preferable), however it's rarely the case when we possess large enough datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, generalization ability of a model that was trained on a larger dataset can be transferred to another, usually, simpler task. In order to reduce the overfitting of our baseline model, we will use weight initialization obtained from the general-purpose model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and further optimize its hyper-parameters using the CUB-200-2011 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Construction of a pre-trained ResNet-50 in PyTorch can be done by passing pretrained=True into constructor. This simple trick provides us with the model that already has well initialized filters, so there is no need to learn them from scratch. We will also set the learning rate 10 times lower, as we are going to train a network that was yet pre-trained on a large-scale image-classification task. Thus, the training process remains the same, while the model will rather focus on the fine-tuning of parameters."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we used different approaches to improve the performance of a baseline ResNet-50 for the classification of bird species from CUB-200-2011 dataset. What could we learn from that? Here are some take-home messages from our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data exploration results indicate the CUB-200-2011 as the high-quality, balanced although center-biased dataset without corrupted images. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In case of the limited amount of training samples, you can reuse weights of the model pre-trained on another (usually larger) dataset in your own model. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning through auxiliary task in addition to the primary bird classification one contributes to the better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhancing the network's architecture by adding new layers (attention  module) makes the model more accurate in bird species classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comparison results of different extentions of the basic ResNet-50 indicate the pre-trained model advanced using auxialary task and attention mechanism as the prominent candidate for the further investigations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there is a space for improvements of the model performance. Additional advancements can be achieved by further optimization of model hyper-parameters, the use of a stronger data augmentation, regularization, meta-learning techniques, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More coming soon! \n",
